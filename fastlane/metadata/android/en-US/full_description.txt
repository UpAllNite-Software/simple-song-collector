<p><i>Simple Song Collector</i> is a very basic Android app that allows search and download of the audio track from Youtube songs and videos.</p><p>There are several subscription music services available on Android, but none of them expose their song files or have a working API/SDK that would allow third party apps to access the users music library. Simple Song Collector will allow the user to find the same songs from their music library and get a physical song file on their Android device that other apps can use.</p><p>It is built primarily on top of the <a href='https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>Newpipe Extractor library</a> with very specific functionality to download the m4a track, add thumbnail, artist and title metadata, and then add the song file to the Android media library where other apps can browse them.</p>
